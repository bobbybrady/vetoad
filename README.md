# Vetoad
I come from a large family, and when we are all together making decisions on what to do can be a challenge. Vetoad is a way to navigate the interactions with the indecisive. Users can create events and add other users to their event. They also have the option to give certain users special permissions.

<b>Login and Registration</b>

Once the user arrives on the launhc page, they have the option to login or register.

<b>How it works</b>
------

Vetoad uses animal emojis as a way to represent the voting system. A Poodle is a vote for something, a Parrot is a vote against something, and a Toad or Vetoad will veto something.
